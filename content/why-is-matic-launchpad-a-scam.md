title: Why is Matic launchpad a scam in our opinion?
---

## Pattern of deceptive behavior

A disturbing trend has emerged, as multiple projects have come forward with similar concerns about Matic Launchpad's business practices. Despite some variations in the specifics of each case, a common pattern of behavior has become apparent:

- An unusually high number of new, empty wallets are being whitelisted for many IDO campaigns on Matic Launchpad.
- Tokens from investors in IDO projects are being funneled into a small number of wallets on exchanges, which then engage in destructive dumping, causing the token price to plummet.
- Matic Launchpad subsequently uses the token crash as a pretext to withhold funds collected from purported investors, rather than paying them out to the projects as promised.

## Red flags indicating potential scam activity

Several other red flags have been raised that suggest Matic Launchpad may be engaged in scam activity:

- The name "Matic Launchpad" bears a suspicious resemblance to "Matic," now known as Polygon, which may be intended to create confusion or a false sense of reliability.
- Despite claiming to be a decentralized platform, Matic Launchpad appears to be centrally managed by a small group of individuals who are actively trying to maintain their anonymity.
- It appears that Matic Launchpad's own token, MATICPAD, fails to meet the standards that the platform imposes on its clients: https://www.coinbase.com/price/matic-launchpad
